    <h2 id="game_lore">Game lore: </h2> 
    <p class="text">An unknown disease spread all across the city, one of its main characteristics
         was deep sleep which in some case took weeks the only known way to break out
         of the deep sleep was for the patient to realize they are in  dream and try to
         find there way out. you found yourself in a strange world with strange huge buildings
         and walls all around you, it took you a while but you realized you are in a dream and you
         should breakout. from what you knew about the disease is that you should 
         reach somewhere which ends the dream but it isnt guranteed to break out
        first try, so you better start quick or else you would be stuck forever!
     </p>
    <h2 id="the_terrain">The Terrain: </h2>
    <p class="text"> floating islands representing different dreams, they come in different
     shapes and sizes each of them with mew mazes and challenges, they contain
     an artifact that represents the end of the dream yor goal is to reach the
     artifacts to end the dream , but take care each time you end a dream you 
     either be lucky and breakout or get into another dream, which might be 
     dangerous as the could be unfinished dreams with broken terrian making 
     it more challenging.artifacts are found in the terrain usually looks 
     like this in game (@).
</p>  <img class="pic" src="the terrain.png" alt="terrian" width="300">
    <h2 id="doors">Doors: </h2>
    <p class="text">Huge heavy looking structures can be best described as meadieval 
        castle doors, its impossible to go through without having the key 
        for it. doors could be found in the terrain and they look like 
        this(I), they usually hide the artifact behind them. make use to open them.
</p>
    <h2 id="keys">Keys: </h2>
    <p class="text">They are no normal keys they have a distinct shape making them
         hard to miss, they are used to open doors and you can spot them 
         if look for  the ($) icon in game. all you have to do is move over 
         them to get a key.
</p>
    <h2 id="voids">Voids: </h2>
    <p class="text">Voids are blank spaces that are really dangerous falling
         through them might get you stuck forever, they usually 
         appear within the terrian but they noticeably increase 
         in unfinished dreams making them unstable and 
         extremely dangerous.
</p>
    <h2 id="Objects">Objects: </h2>
    <p class="text">slightly heavy structures found around the terrain they 
        look like a half barrel this shape makes them extremely 
        helpful to pass voids, pushing them over voids will create 
        a path almost like a bridge. they can only be used as a 
        bridge once, you have to wisely choose where to use them.
        you should find them looking like this (D) in game.
</p>
    <h2 id="last_dream">The Last Dream: </h2>
    <P class="text">getting to the last Dream might be challenging 
        but here are the characteristics of the dream shall you reach it
        , you usually have a mirrored character that would mirror 
        all your moves. you could use it to help you get out it can 
        collect keys, open doors and much more. your goal is no different 
        than the other dreams you  need to reach the artifact, but this 
        time it will get you out of the dreams.<br><br>
